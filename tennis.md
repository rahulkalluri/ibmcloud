Tennis shot
In tennis, there are a variety of types of shots (ways of hitting the ball) which can be categorized in various
ways. The grip you place on will help you have different types of shots, the lower your grip means that the
ball is most likely going to be a ground stroke. According to William T. Tilden, "All tennis strokes, should
be made with the body' at right angles to the net, with the shoulders lined up parallel to the line of flight of
the ball."[1] The serve is the opening shot of a point. Groundstrokes are hit after the ball has already
bounced, and can be either forehands or backhands depending on which direction the racket is swung
relative to the body. A lob is a groundstroke hit well over the head of an opponent who is positioned at the
net. A passing shot is a groundstroke that is hit out of reach of an opponent at the net far to his left or right.
A cross-court shot is a shot hit from the left (or right) side of one player's court to the left (or right) side of
the other player's court (from each player's own point of view), so that it crosses the lengthwise centerline of
the court. A down-the-line shot is one that is hit more or less parallel to, and near to, one of the sidelines, so
that it never crosses the centerline.
Shots hit during a point without the ball having bounced are called volleys, while shots hit just a split
second after the ball bounces are called half volleys. A smash is hit with the racket well above one's head
with great velocity. A drop shot is a groundstroke or volley that is hit lightly so that it barely goes over the
net.
A slice is a groundstroke or volley hit with backspin, while a topspin shot is a groundstroke or occasionally
a volley hit with topspin.
Thus tennis shots can be categorized according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half
volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where
they are hit (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).
All shots that pass either over or around the net and land anywhere within the confines of the court, lines
included (except for serves, which need to land inside the designated service box), are considered good.
Shots that touch the net and then land in their designated area are also considered good, with the exception
of serves. Serves that fall into the service box after touching the net are called service lets, and the server
simply serves again, without any impact on the scoring.
A serve (or, more formally, a service) in tennis is a shot to begin the point. The most common serve is used
is an overhead serve. It is initiated by tossing the ball into the air over the server's head and hitting it when
the arm is fully stretched out (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box
without touching the net. The server may employ different types of serve: a flat, a top-spin, an American
twist (or kick), or a slice serve. A severely sliced serve is sometimes called a sidespin. Some servers are
content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with
their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an ace.
Serve
Forehand
The forehand is struck from the dominant side of the body by swinging the racquet in the direction of where
the player wants to place the shot. It is called a forehand because the racquet is held in such a way that if
one were to strike the ball without the racquet, it would hit the palm of your hand. This is the opposite side
from a backhand. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke.
Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.
There are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The
most important ones are the Continental, the Eastern, and the Western. The key differences between grips
are the different angles they create between the angle of your palm and the angle of your racquet face. You
are used to sensing the direction your palm is facing, so your palm makes the most intuitive basis for
sensing the direction your racquet is facing. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player
Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit
shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, but in the latter
part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand
made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most
forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with
two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-
handed forehand to devastating effect against larger, more powerful players, and many female and young
players use the two-handed stroke today.
The backhand is struck from the non-dominant side of the body by bringing the racquet across the body
(showing the back of your hand to the opponent) and swinging the racquet away from one's body in the
direction of where the player wants the ball to go. It is generally considered more difficult to master than the
forehand. It can be executed with either one or both hands. For most of the 20th Century it was performed
with one hand, using either an eastern or a continental grip. The first notable players to use two hands were
the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. The two-handed backhand was used more
often since it allowed easy access to power and control. Players such as Venus Williams, Serena Williams,
Maria Sharapova, and Andre Agassi have used this stroke to its highest potential to win many grandslams.
Two hands give the player more power so it provides the player with an advantage on power-focused shots.
However, one hand is useful in that it can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a
low trajectory bounce. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge,
had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken
Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a deadly accurate slice backhand with
underspin through the 1950s and '60s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on
both the backhand and forehand sides.
A volley is made in the air before the ball bounces, generally near the net or inside of the service line.
Volleys consist of the forehand volley and backhand volley[2] and are usually made with a stiff-wristed
"punching" motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent's court. The half volley is made by
hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, once again generally in the vicinity of the net. From a
poor defensive position on the baseline, the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon,
hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent's court to either enable the lobber (the player hitting the lob)
to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent's head. If the
Backhand
Volley
lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, the opponent may then hit an overhead smash, a
hard, serve-like shot (hit over the player's head), to end the point. Finally, if an opponent is deep in his
court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, softly tapping the ball just over the net so
that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it.
